S3 : Same Region Replication / CRR.. Versioning (DR) + MFA Delete.. 

EC2 :   (AZ + AZ) + ASG --> ELB --> Cloudfront --> WAF (Web Application Firewall) 
				--> GLobal Accelerator
ELB Needs to deliver using Fixed IP addresses: Firewall, WHitelist.. : Network ELB

	ec2 --> Need to access S3 : Always use Roles 
		(--> Ec2 in Private subnet w/o internet: Gateway endpoints)

Route53 : 
--> Latency RP : We need application in multiple Regions.. 
--> Weighted RP : Whenever multiple versions of app.. 
--> Failover RP : Primary --> app + Secondary (s3 static)

--> We use "Alias" record : s3bucket, elb, cft, beanstalk

VPC : 
--> Always create min of 2 AZs/ Subnets.. 
--> IGW 
--> NAT gateway : Providing internet to privaten subnet instances, Always runs in Public Subnets, TO patch. download anything from external endpoints.. We can run/add multiple NAT gateways to a VPC.. 
VPC Peering : TO enable communication between multiple VPCs..
Transit Gateway : We are using VPC peering, becoming complex when VPC count is increasing.. 

RDS : 
--> MultiAZ : One AZ down also, Should not get effected.. 
--> ReadReplica : Heavy read operations..     
	Primary: Application / RR: Generating report.. 
--> gaming / Iot / ad-tech / Single DIgit ms latency : DynamoDB
--> Caching :   RDS--> Elasticache / DynamoDB --> DAX
--> Aurora have a feature : Global Database.. 

SQS : Decoupled appication.. Long Polling / short polling.. DeadLetter Queue.. 

FSx : Windows Instances : SMB protocol : Can be integrated with AD : 
EFS : Linux Instances : NFS Protocol : 
Storage Gateway : 

Kinesis : Shards/streams/analysis.. 




File Gateway
--> For flat files, stored directly on S3. 

Volume Gateway 
--> Stored Volumes - Entire Dataset is stored on site and is asynchronously backed up to S3. 
--> Cached Volumes - Entire Dataset is stored on S3 and the most frequently accessed data is cached on site. 

Gateway Virtual Tape Library (VTL) 
--> Back up your data to Amazon S3 and archive in Amazon Glacier using your existing tape-based processes. Supports popular backup applications like NetBackup, Backup Exec, Veeam etc. 


SG Mechanism : 

EFS --> EC2 (SG) EFS (SG)
RDS --> Ec2 (sg) RDS (SG)
 --> RDS --> ec2--> ELB

ELB/NAT/Bastian/Jump : Public Subnet
Web Servers : Private 
Db :  private Subnet
