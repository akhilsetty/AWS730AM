RDS : Relational Database Service

AWS RDS Supports 6 Relational DB Engines.
--> Amazon Aurora	: 
--> Mysql		: Mysql workbench
--> PostGreSQL		: PgAdmin
--> MariaDB		: Workbench
--> Oracle DB		: Toad
--> MS Sql		: SSMS (SQL server management studio)

NoSQL Database : Serverless : DynamoDB
Datawaresousing : Amazon RedShift
In Memory Caching : Elasticache (MemcacheD & Redis)

We won't get any IP Address for RDS instances. We willg et Endpoints. 


LAMP : Linux , Apache, Mysql, Php : 


Multi-AZ Deployment :

ReadReplica :

Backup : Snapshot : 
--> Automated backup/ss : Creates automatically whwen ever we performs any major operations on our DB. We cannot delete these automated ss. When we delete DB instance, all automated ss will delete aitomatically.

--> Manual ss : We need to create manually. Along with DB , these will not delete, We need to delete manually.


Task : Complete the WP task

Task 2 : Launch MSSQL in RDS, Launch an instance in public subnet, install SSMS and get connect to MSSQL db.

Amazon Aurora :
--> Amazon Aurora with MySQL compatibility
--> Amazon Aurora with PostgreSQL compatibility

Database Location : 
Regional :You provision your Aurora database in a single AWS Region.
Global : You can provision your Aurora database in multiple AWS Regions. Writes in the primary AWS Region are replicated with typical latency of less than 1 sec to secondary AWS Regions.


One writer and multiple readers :
Supports multiple reader instances connected to the same storage volume as a single writer instance. This is a good general-purpose option for most workloads.




Restore from S3 : 

DMS : Database Migration Service : 

Homogenious Migration : MySql (on-prem) --> DMS --> MySql (aws)
Heterogenious migration : MongoDB (on-prem) --> SCT (Schema COnvertion Tool) --> DMS --> 			  MySQL/PostgreSQL/Aurora


Percona xtrabackup : Tool to take on-premise db backup, and upload it to an s3 bucket.. Later use "Restore from s3" feature. 

______

NoSQL : ServerLess Architecture : DynamoDB : 

--> single-digit millisecond latency at any scale.
--> great fit for mobile, web, gaming, ad-tech, IoT, and many other applications.

DAX: Dynamodb Accelerator : In-Memory Caching for SynamoDB table.. 


DynamoDB : We can deliver Tic-Tac-Toe application.. 


Usercase : Dynamodb, Benastalk, roles, git, cli, pip
