S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> Object Based : S3 : We can store flat files.. .pdf, .docx, .exe, .mp3..
--> Block Based : EBS / Instance Store (ec2) : Designed to install OS.. 
--> Storage over the Network / NAS (ec2) : 

--> S3 is Object based storage.
--> Stores data in buckets. 
--> S3 is a global platform.
--> We create buckets in required region.
--> Soft Limit : 100 Buckets.
--> Bucket names should be unique.
--> Naming Limitations (DNS Naming standards)
	--> Charactors Min: 3, Max 63 Char
	--> Should not start with .  / End with . / No ..

Virtual Path: (Not works always.. Works when we don;t have . in bucket names)
