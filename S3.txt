S3 : Simple Storage Service : 

--> Object Based : S3 : We can store flat files.. .pdf, .docx, .exe, .mp3..
--> Block Based : EBS / Instance Store (ec2) : Designed to install OS.. 
--> Storage over the Network / NAS (ec2) : 

--> S3 is Object based storage.
--> Stores data in buckets. 
--> S3 is a global platform.
--> We create buckets in required region.
--> Soft Limit : 100 Buckets.
--> Bucket names should be unique.
--> Naming Limitations (DNS Naming standards)
	--> Charactors Min: 3, Max 63 Char
	--> Should not start with .  / End with . / No .. 
	--> Should not contains any capital letters. 
	--> Should not resemble IP address format.

--> Min Object Size : 0 bytes..   
--> Max Obj size : 5 TB
--> S3 have unlimited storage. 

 
Standard URL: 
https://s3.regionanme.amazonaws.com/bucketname/objectname
https://s3.ap-south-1.amazonaws.com/avinash72/IAM.txt


Virtual Path: (Not works always.. Works when we don;t have . in bucket names)

--> If you want to make any object publicly accesable, First Disable "Block oublic access" permission on bucket level. 
THen, Change the Object level permissions.. 

Free Tier : 5 GB Standard Storage/ Month.. 2000 PUT and 20,000 GET operations..

Versioning :
--> Versioning will be in "Suspended" state by defaultly.
--> We can track all the changes happening on our files.
--> We will get a version ID for every upload. We cannot manage Version ID. 
--> Uploaded time is Imp.. (Most recent upload called as Latest Version)

SRR / CRR : 

Task : Perform Same Region Replication with Stanadrd Storage in Source and Destination buckets.

Task 2 : What is the Priority order when we apply multiple SRR/CRR. 


LCR : Lifecycle Management Rule : 

--> We can transit objects from one storage to class to another storage class automatically. / Automate the storage class transition on our objects.
--> We can trigger to delete the objects also.

Latest Version : Expire
Previous version : Deletes Perminently


Static Hosting : Fixed Website : 

--> Domain Name = Bucket Name			Route53
--> Index.html (Default webpage) / Error.html (Custom Errors)
--> Make sure you give atleast "Read Only" permissions on your objects.

Http Status codes:

2XX --> OK/Success
3XX --> Redirection Error
4XX --> Client Side Error
5XX --> Server Side Error

Server access logging : 
--> Logging feature on our s3 bucket.

KMS : Key Management Service : 


In-Transit Encryption : 
	--> SSL / TLS

Server Side Encryption / At-Rest : 
	--> AES-256 Encryption / SSE-S3		(S3 is Responsible for Ency and Decry)
	--> AWS- KMS Managed Key (SSE-KMS)
	--> AWS-KMS Customer Managed Key (SSE-C)

Client Side Encryption : 
	--> Cutomer responsible
	--> We can use this CSE along with AWS SDK tools.


http: cc/db .. Man In Middle attack.. 
https: Secure over http

CMK : Customer Master key (CMK) is a logical representation od Master Key. THe CMK contains Metadata KeyID, Creation date, Desc, Key State. COntains Key material used to Encrypt and Decrypt. 

Symmetric CMK : It's a single 256-bit secret encryption.  One key for Encry and Decry.
Asymetric CMK : We will have public key and private key. We need both the keys to perform encry or decryp. 


Key Administrator Permissions : 
Key Usage Permissions : 

Customer Managed : 365 Days is Key Rotation (1 year)
AWS Managed Keys : 1095 Days (3 Years)
AWS Owned keys : Varies (Depends on AWS)

Task : Encrypt the s3 data using AES-256, upload the data and verify the status
Create an new IAM user with S3 full Access, try to read the encrypted data and try to disable the encryption on bucket.
__________

Object Lock : We cans ecure data from deletions. Including root user also.
--> While create bucket itself we need to enable this feature. 
--> Versioning must be enabled. 


Governance mode can be disabled by AWS accounts that have specific IAM permissions.
Compliance mode cannot be disabled by any user, including the root account.


Task : Create an Object lock on your s3 bucket and enable for 2 days. 
	Switch to root user and try to delete the objects.

_____

Tags : We can give/define required metadata on our s3 bucket. Tag contains Key and Value.

Transfer Acceleration : used Edge location to perform upload/download operation to given bucket.

______


Events on S3 with SNS : 

S3 Events supports :
--> SNS (Simple Notification Service) : Email Notifications
--> SQS (Simple Queue Service)
--> Lambda

Task : Create an SNS topic, Add multiple subscribers.. Configure to get notification when an object is deleted from your s3 bucket.
